            <p>Hello! I'm Emmanuel Oyewole, a passionate software developer with experience in creating efficient and scalable solutions using a variety of technologies. My journey in programming started with learning basic html and css skills from high school to further developing myself on other languages like C, C++, Java, and others. Over the years, I have worked on multiple projects that showcase my skills in web development, machine learning, and more.</p>
            <p>I'm always eager to learn new things and take on challenging projects. I enjoy solving complex problems, and I believe that my analytical and creative skills help me develop innovative solutions.</p>
            <p>In my spare time, I enjoy going to the gym, playing soccer, playing video games, practicing the piano and work on my programming prowess, which helps me stay creative and motivated.</p>
