                <h3>Project 1: Chic Lighting</h3>
                <p>This project involved creating the front-end of a website for Chic Lighting, an online store specializing in household lighting equipment such as chandeliers, lamps, and pendant lights. The website was designed to offer an intuitive and user-friendly experience for customers looking to browse and purchase lighting products.</p>
                <p> I designed and implemented responsive web pages using HTML/CSS for structure and styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements.</p>

                <h3>Project 3: Countdown Timer</h3>
                <p>The Countdown Timer project is a simple web application that allows users to set a countdown by entering the hours, minutes, and seconds. Once the user clicks "Start," the timer begins counting down, updating every second until it reaches zero. When the countdown finishes, an alert notifies the user that the time is up. The user can also reset the timer at any time.</p>
